# Purpose of the Loop:
# The loop is designed to compare elements from nums1 and nums2 and place the larger one at the end of the merged array (nums1).
# The pointers i and j track the current positions in nums1 and nums2, respectively.
# Stopping Condition:
# The loop continues as long as both i and j are valid (i.e., i >= 0 and j >= 0).
# If either i or j becomes negative, it means weâ€™ve exhausted all elements in one of the arrays, and we no longer need to compare elements.
# Why Both Arrays?:
# We need to compare elements from both arrays to determine which one is larger and should be placed in the merged array.
# If one array is exhausted (e.g., j < 0), we can simply copy the remaining elements from the other array without further comparisons.
# What Happens When One Array Is Exhausted?
# If nums1 Is Exhausted (i < 0):
# This means all elements from nums1 have been processed.
# We can simply copy the remaining elements from nums2 into nums1.
# If nums2 Is Exhausted (j < 0):
# This means all elements from nums2 have been processed.
# The remaining elements in nums1 are already in the correct position, so no further action is needed.
